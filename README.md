### MRDialog

mrdialog is a pure
[ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) library for the ncurses
[dialog](http://invisible-island.net/dialog/dialog.html) program.
[dialog](http://invisible-island.net/dialog/dialog.html) is
a command line tool that can present questions, messages, forms using
dialog boxes from a shell script. If you compiled linux kernel and typed 'make
menuconfig', configured Linux from command line with various configuration
managers, you have used 'dialog' like programs.

However, it is painful to program dialog from shell scripts due to lack of
data structure. You constantly have to watch if the correct number of
items are specified, if the arguments are in correct order for example. It is
a lot of fun to program dialog from an object oriented scripting language like
[ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). Compare the sample shell scripts of dialog program with
the sample ruby scripts of mrdialog in the [samples](samples/) directory, I think you will agree. Look at [samples/extra_button/](samples/extra_button/) directory for samples on using an extra button on various input dialogs.

MRDialog is based on the rdialog ruby gem http://rdialog.rubyforge.org/ by
Aleks Clark.

I did the following:

- Added features and support for all of the missing widgets.
- Fixed the bugs I found.
- Implemented the examples for all the widgets.

If you have bug reports, questions, requests or suggestions, please enter it in the [Issues](https://github.com/muquit/mrdialog/issues) with an appropriate label.

### Latest Version

The latest version is 1.0.4.
Please look at the [ChangeLog.md](ChangeLog.md) file for details. Please look at he [screenshots](screenshots/) to see how the widgets look like.

### Screenshots

Please look at the [screenshots](screenshots/) directory. There are individual screenshots for each of the widgets. Also the animated GIF file [all.gif](screenshots/all.gif) contains screenshot of all the widgets.

### Requirements

The [dialog](http://invisible-island.net/dialog/dialog.html) program must be installed. Note: the dialog program that is available in ubuntu is little old. Check the dialog version by typing `dialog --version`

I tested with `dialog Version: 1.2-20130928`

dialog HOME: http://invisible-island.net/dialog/dialog.html.

### To install

`# gem install mrdialog`
or
`$ sudo gem install mrdialog`

### To uninstall

`# gem uninstall mrdialog` or `$ sudo gem uninstall mrdialog`

### Run the sample apps

Find out where the mrdialog gem is installed. Example:

    $ gem which mrdialog
    /Users/muquit/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.0.0/gems/mrdialog-1.0.4/lib/mrdialog.rb

`cd` to the `samples` directory and run the apps.
Example:

    $ cd /Users/muquit/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.0.0/gems/mrdialog-1.0.4/samples
    $ ./msgbox.rb

Look at samples/extra_button/ on how to use an extra button on various input
dialogs.

### How to use the API

For now, please look at the apps in [samples](samples/) directory to see how the API works.

    require 'mrdialog'
    dialog = MRDialog.new

#### Properties

The various properties of the dialog (shadow, title etc.) can be set by calling the appropriate setters. The supported properties are shown below:

#### Widgets

The following dialog widgets are supported:

##### buildlist

A buildlist dialog displays two lists, side-by-side. The list on the left shows unselected items. The list on the right shows selected items. As items are selected or unselected, they move between the lists. The SPACE bar is used to
select or unselect an item.

Use a carriage return or the "OK" button to accept the current value in the selected-window and exit. The results are written using the order displayed in the selected-window. The caller is responsible to create the items properly. Please look at [buildlist.rb](samples/buildlist.rb) for an example.

returns an array of selected tags
